tempo2-anisotropy-plugins
=========================

Plugins for Tempo2 to generate anisotropic GW backgrounds with arbitrary polarisation.

There are 6 different plugins included in this repository, which generate GW backgrounds of different types, as described in the following.

User can specify amplitude and direction of dipole anisotropy, or a more general angular distribution via the coefficients of a spherical harmonic decomposition.
